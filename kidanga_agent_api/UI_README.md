## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent Won't Start**:
- Check if Google Places API key is configured
- Verify .env file has required credentials
- Check system status indicators

**WhatsApp Not Ready**:
- QR code needs to be scanned with your phone
- Keep phone connected to internet
- WhatsApp Web session may have expired

**Email Test Fails**:
- Check SendGrid API key in .env file
- Verify sender email is verified with SendGrid
- Try using Gmail/Nodemailer as fallback

**No Businesses Found**:
- Check Google Places API quota
- Verify API key has Places API enabled
- Try reducing search limit or different keywords

### WebSocket Connection Issues

If real-time updates stop working:
1. Refresh the browser page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Restart the UI server: `npm run ui`

### Performance Tips

**For Best Performance**:
- Use search limits of 10-50 for regular use
- Run during off-peak hours for better API response
- Monitor API quotas to avoid hitting limits
- Use targeted searches for specific needs

**Resource Usage**:
- Each search query uses 1 Google Places API call
- Additional calls for business details
- WhatsApp and email services have their own limits
